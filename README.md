# all_leagues-_prediction

**all_leagues-_prediction** is an open-source football (soccer) prediction platform designed for fans, data scientists, and developers who want to analyze matches and forecast outcomes across a variety of football leagues. This project leverages Python and modern web technologies to deliver reproducible, customizable football predictions and analytics.

## Features

- Predict outcomes for football matches across multiple leagues
- Built-in data ingestion and preprocessing tools
- Model training and evaluation (with support for custom models)
- Interactive visualizations and reporting
- Extensible for custom features, additional leagues, and new prediction algorithms
- Community-driven and open for contributions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (core backend, modeling, and data processing)
- **Node.js & npm** (for front-end components, if any)
- (See `requirements.txt` and `package.json` for a full list)

### Installation

1. **Fork this repository** using the "Fork" button at the top right.
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash

   cd all_leagues-_prediction
   ```

3. **Set up the backend:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Environment setup:**
